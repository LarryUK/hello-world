# hello-world

Baby-steps at a programming marathon.

Since marrying, having a child, selling a flat and throwing the profits into a money-pit of a house, I've spent a lot of time wondering about the choices I've made since I last set a focused goal many years ago. 

Via the starter drug of the writings of Tim Ferriss, I've spent the last year buying books, listening to podcasts and generally scratching the undefined itch.

Following the discovery of seemingly kindred-spirit Derek Sivers, I find myself here.

Still not certain of the goal, however taking solice that I am now at least in the rabbit warren even though I don't know which way to go.
